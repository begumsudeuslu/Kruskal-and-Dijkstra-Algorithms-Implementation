# Kruskal-and-Dijkstra-Algorithms-Implementation
This repository contains implementations of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a graph. Both algorithms are essential in graph theory and are widely used in network routing, spanning tree protocols, and various optimization problems.
