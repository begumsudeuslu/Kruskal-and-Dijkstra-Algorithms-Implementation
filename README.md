# Kruskal-and-Dijkstra-Algorithms-Implementation
This repository contains implementations of Kruskal's Algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a graph. Both algorithms are essential in graph theory and are widely used in network routing, spanning tree protocols, and various optimization problems.

Features
  - Kruskal's Algorithm: Uses a greedy approach to construct an MST by sorting edges and applying the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure.
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm: Computes the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices using a priority queue (min-heap).
  - Graph Representation: Implements graph input handling, adjacency list representation, and efficient edge sorting.
  - Optimized Performance: Uses efficient data structures such as priority queues and disjoint sets.
